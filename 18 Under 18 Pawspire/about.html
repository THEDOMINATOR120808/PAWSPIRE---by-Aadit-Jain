      <div id="about_explaination">Hi! I'm Aadit the creator of app. I adopted a stray dog and he inspired me to create this app. When he showed up on our doorstep, he looked
          lost and we gave him a place to stay. The next day he was about to be run over by a car and that's when we decided that we were gonna adopt
          him and help him till he needs us. However, we realised that we both needed each other in our own ways and he is with us till this date. 
          When we got him home, I was clueless. It's been my life long dream to have a pup and now when one finally shows up on my doorstep I don't know 
          how to help him. Like what food to give him, what chew toys should I get him, how much exercise should he get, how much and what to feed him, 
          and the list goes on. So that inspired me to create this webapp to help those who recently adopted a pet with listing down a certain set of needs.
