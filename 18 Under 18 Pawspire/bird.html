      <div id="bird_food">
        You should feed your bird a combination of both a high quality commercial food and some natural foods. e.g. fresh fruit, 
        vegetables, seeding grasses, native flowers, green foods etc that are appropriate and safe for the particular bird species.
        Vegetables and fruits are great additions to your bird's balanced diet, but do not comprise a complete diet in themselves. 
        Choose vegetables such as corn, broccoli, carrots, yams and peas rather than iceberg lettuce or celery, which are lacking in 
        nutrients and simply are a source of water and fiber.
      </div>
      <div id="bird_vaccine">
        A few vaccines are available for pet birds (notably polyomavirus vaccine), but most caged birds are not routinely vaccinated. 
        If you have questions about the need to vaccinate your bird, you should discuss your concerns with your veterinarian.
      </div>
      <div id="bird_exercise">
        Buying things like ropes and ladders for your pet to climb on can encourage movement and working of major muscle groups in your 
        bird. Finding fun "foot toys" for your bird to toss around and play with outside of his or her cage can promote good exercise habits as well.
      </div>
      <div id="bird_needs">
        You need to get your bird a cage big enough and give it a hiding place. You also need to get it a food and water bowl.
