    <div id="cat_food">
      Cats are meat eaters, plain and simple. They have to have protein from meat for a strong heart, good vision, and a healthy reproductive 
      system. Cooked beef, chicken, turkey, and small amounts of lean deli meats are a great way to give them that. If you are searching for veg 
      options then you can feed your cat asparagus (steamed), baked carrots, bananas, blueberries, carrots (steamed), cooked winter squash, 
      green beans and/or broccoli (steamed only), melon etc.

      <div id="cat exercise">
        Most indoor cats do not get enough exercise each day whilst some outdoor felines do get a sufficient amount. Experts recommend that 
        cats should ideally spend an average of 30 minutes doing moderate exercise each day.
      </div>
      <div id="cat_vaccination">
        Primary vaccination is essential in order to prevent the return of the once common deadly infectious diseases in kittens and cats. 
        Recent research indicates that not all vaccines require yearly boosters. However, there is no evidence that annual booster vaccination 
        is anything but beneficial to the majority of cats.
