  <div class="dog_explanation">
  <div id="dog_food">
    It is entirely acceptable to feed your dog a pure kibble diet. Or you can mix their diet up with some cooked or raw meat, fish, 
    vegetables and rice. Many owners like to feed a raw meat diet to their dogs, and while this can suit some dogs very well, there are 
    some important considerations you need to be aware of. 
  </div>
  <div id="dairy_products">
    Milk and milk-based products can cause diarrhea and other digestive problems for your pup. They can also trigger food allergies, 
    which can cause them to itch.
  </div>
  <div id="dog_food">
    Cottage Cheese or Paneer can be a good treat option for the dogs as it contains nutrients like Calcium, Proteins et cetera which are highly 
    useful for them and it is also quite low in fat. ... And, if the dog is lactose intolerant, then the paneer should be kept as far away from 
    him/her as possible. If you are trying to make your dog vegan, any raw vegetables in a dog's diet should be grated or put through a food 
    processor to enhance digestibility. To help with the adjustment to a vegetarian or vegan diet, start by mixing the vegetarian food in with what 
    you usually serve. Gradually change the proportion until there is no meat left. If your dog isn't eating the food you give him/her then you can 
    add a little bit of raw egg to make it taste better and attract your dog towards it. 
  </div>
  <div id="poison_food">
      A few poisonous food items for dogs are, on top of the list CHOCOLATE and chocolate based products, plant foods in the Allium genus (including 
      onions, garlic, leeks and chives), macadamia nuts, Vitis vinifera fruits (including grapes, raisins, sultanas and currants). Read this list VERY 
      carefully so that you don't end up feeding your dog one of these things by mistake! The list does go on so make sure to be very careful of whatever 
      you feed your dog.
  </div>
  <div id="chew_toys_dogs">
      You need to get your pup chew toys especially when in his/her teething stage or he might bite you, or destroy things around him/her like sandals.
      It's not compulsary to buy a new one from outside. Instead you can give your pup anything that's chewable, pullable and tuggable. You could also 
      give him/her a old soft toy of yours that you are no longer using or you are about to give away.
  </div>
  <div id="vaccinations_dog">
      A dog needs his vaccinations in order to be fit and healthy. You need to take your dog to a vet once he turns around 4-6 weeks old. Some 
      vaccinations are given as a combination, such as the DHLPPC, which helps protect against distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parainfluenza, 
      parvo and corona. Other vaccinations are administered one at a time. Once given his 1st vaccination you could ask the vet when to come back again 
      for the next depending on which vaccine he has been given.
  </div>
  <div id="exercise_dog">
    You should take your dog for atleast 2-3 walks a day and let him roam around outdoors in the garden if you have one, or around your house.
    The recommended amount of daily exercise for most dogs is 30 minutes to 2 hours, although certain dogs need more. Some breeds were developed 
    for more active lifestyles than others.
