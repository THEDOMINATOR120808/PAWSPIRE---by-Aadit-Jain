      <div id="fish_food">
        Because of the high cost of animal proteins, food fish diets are made up of all plant feedstuffs. Traditional high-cost ingredients 
        such as soybean meal and corn are being replaced partially by alternative ingredients such as cottonseed meal, corn gluten feed, corn germ 
        meal, and DDGS. If you run out of fish food, you can feed them boiled vegetables, peas or small pieces of seafood like white fish or shrimp. 
        It's better to opt for freeze-dried food rather than live food to avoid the chance of transferring infections to your fish.

      <div id="fish_tank">
        A fish needs a tank to live in. The size of the tank usually depends on the size of the fish. Usually each inch of the fish needs a gallon of 
        water. Some of the only fish that can safely be kept in fish bowls include: Betta, White Clouds, and Guppies. These fish are very small, don't 
        require a lot of space for movement, and are fine living on their own (the Betta you actually need to keep by itself). You could also decorate the 
        tank with some sea plants or a few rocks where the fish can hide or play. To make it a bit more decorative you could add marbles and the bottom. 
        You also need a water conditioner which can de chlorinate the water making it safe for your fish(es).

      <div id="fish_vaccine">
        There are three major modes for the application of vaccines: oral, immersion and injection. However in all cases, only healthy fish should be 
        vaccinated as it is a preventive measure and not a cure.
