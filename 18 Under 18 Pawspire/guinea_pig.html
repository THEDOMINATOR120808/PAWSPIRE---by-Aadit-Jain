      <div id="about_pet">
      <div id="guinea_pig_adopt">
        Some guinea pigs enjoy being cuddled or snuggled. Others prefer to be left alone. Since they are prey animals, they naturally try to 
        avoid being picked up. ... It is often a good idea to adopt in pairs or groups (as long as they are all the same gender) as they can 
        be social animals with one another.
      </div>
      <div id="guinea_pig_diet">
        The preferred basic diet for guinea pigs is unlimited amounts of Timothy or other low-calcium hay, 
        supplemented with smaller amounts of a commercial, high-fiber, Timothy-hay based guinea pig pellets. Vitamin C (see below) 
        should be given each day. Hay should be offered free-choice throughout the day. One can also give them lettuce, carrots, cauliflower
        leaves and some pellets. For a special snack, try mixing some rolled oats into your guinea pig's pellets or stuff a small 
        cardboard tube with fresh hay. 
      </div>
      <div id="guinea_pig_poison">
        Some food items are poisonous for guinea pigs. They include - biscuits and crackers, bread, chocolate of any kind, dairy products, 
        peanut butter, potato chips, pickled foods of any kind, sugary foods, and non veg.
      </div>
      <div id="guinea_pig_exercise">
        Ideally, a guinea pig will enjoy 3-4 hours of free range play time each day, especially if 
        their cage habitat is small. Even with a big cage, however, it is important to provide 
        adequate exercise out of the cage, and guinea pigs that can get these good workouts will be happier, healthier and better adjusted.
      </div>
      <div id="guinea_pig_toys">
          You can make a tunnel out of cardboard for the guinea pigs to hide and play. You also need to get them a water bottle that can be attached
          to the cage and a sipper for them to have the water. Guinea pigs don't need to be bathed very often, once a month at most. Many owners bathe 
          their guinea pigs monthly in the summer, and every two months in the winter.To give them a bath, make sure you do not get water directly onto 
          their ears or face. Lather the guinea pig shampoo all over their body. Rinse the guinea pig two to three times to make sure all the shampoo 
          is gone. Wrap them in a towel and then blow dry them on the cold setting.
      </div>
      <div id="vaccinations">
        While guinea pigs do not require any vaccinations, it is recommended that you take your pet to a veterinarian familiar with guinea pigs at 
        least once each year for a routine checkup.
