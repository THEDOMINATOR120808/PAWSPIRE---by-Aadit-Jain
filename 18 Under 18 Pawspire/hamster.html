          When feeding your hamster fruits or vegetables make sure you give them a good wash before you feed them to your hamster and only 
          feed a small amount each day. A few vegetables suitable for a hamster include carrot, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, chicory, spinach, 
          sweet peppers, cucumber, cress, courgette. A few fruits include apple, pear, peach, melon. Donâ€™t feed citrus fruits, such as 
          oranges, lemons or grapefruits, to your hamster. A few herbs include basil, sage, parsley, coriander.

        <div id="hamster_bath">
          Hamsters are naturally clean animals who spend as much as 20% of their time grooming themselves regularly and have almost no odour. 
          Therefore, there's no need to bathe them frequently in order to maintain a healthy level of cleanliness.
        </div>
        <div id="hamster_chew_toys">
          If your hamster needs something to gnaw on, you can give it cardboard, coconut shells, hay cubes, unbleached loofah, pumice stone, seagrass.

        <div id="hamster_exercise">
          Some pet owners choose to incorporate their hamsters' playtime into their daily schedule; setting aside 20-30 minutes each day for 
          their restless pets to roam about freely outside their cages. Though many people advice a ball or a exercise wheel I don't cause 
          your hamster might get confused on how to stop and get off and might get injured badly.
        </div>
      <div id="hamster_vaccine">
        Hamsters do not require vaccinations. However, hamsters require, at minimum, annual physical examinations, and fecal tests to check for parasites. 
        Older hamsters should be examined twice annually.
